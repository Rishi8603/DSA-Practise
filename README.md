# Java DSA Practice

This repository contains my Java Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice, organized by topic. It includes problems solved from platforms like LeetCode, and covers both fundamental and advanced topics.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Arrays` – Basic and advanced array problems
- `Backtracking` – Combinatorial problems using recursion and decision trees
- `Basic` – Beginner-level problems and syntax practice
- `BinarySearch` – Binary search on arrays and search space
- `BitManipulation` – XOR, bit masking, etc.
- `Contest` – Solutions to coding contest problems
- `DP` – Dynamic Programming problems
- `Graphs` – BFS, DFS, shortest paths, etc.
- `Greedy` – Greedy approach-based problems
- `Hashing` – HashMaps, Sets, frequency maps
- `Heaps` – Min/Max heaps and priority queues
- `LeetcodeDaily` – Daily problems from LeetCode
- `LinkedList` – Singly, doubly, and operations on linked lists
- `Maths` – Number theory, GCD, modular arithmetic
- `OOPs` – Java Object-Oriented Programming practice
- `Pattern` – Pattern printing problems
- `Practise` – Random problems for hands-on practice
- `Prefix` – Prefix sums, prefix arrays
- `Queues` – Queue and deque-based problems
- `Recursion` – Recursive problems and breakdowns
- `SlidingWindow` – Fixed and variable-size window techniques
- `Sorting` – Custom sorts, merge/quick sort, etc.
- `Stacks` – Stack-based logic and problem-solving
- `String` – String manipulation and pattern-matching
